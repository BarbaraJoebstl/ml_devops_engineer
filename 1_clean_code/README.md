# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This is a project to showcase how to make code provided in a jupyter notebook production ready.
This includes:
- reuse code via functions
- store plots to a folder
- use logging instead of printing


## Files and data description
### Files
#### churn_notebook.ipynb
Notebook that holds the code that should be used
#### churn_library.py
Python script that holds the refactored functionality
#### churn_constants.py
Holds the needed constants
#### churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
Testclass for the functionality provided in `churn_library.py`.

### Folders
#### data
Holds the input data.
#### images
Holds the images that are stored when runnging the `churn_library.py`.
#### logs
Holds the logs that are stored when runnging the `churn_library.py`.
#### models 
Holds the logs that are stored when runnging the `churn_library.py`.


## Running Files
Install the needed libraries from `requirments_py3.10.txt`

### Execute the training of the model
