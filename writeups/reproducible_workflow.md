# Machine Learning Pipelines

Create a clean, organized, reproducible, end-to-end machine learning pipeline from scratch
Transform, validate and verify your data (avoid “garbage in, garbage out”)
Run experiments, track data, code, and results
Select the best performing model and promote it to production
Create an artifact ready for deployment, and release your final pipeline
